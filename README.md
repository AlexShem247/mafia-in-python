# Mafia in Python by Alexander Shemaly

Mafia in Python is inspired by the party game Mafia, where one person out of a group of people is chosen to be the murderer and it is the role of the other players to find out who it is.
In this game, you play against AI players, where they will talk with you, ask you questions and place their suspicions.
Get assigned as either the murderer, doctor, detective or innocent and use your various perks to help win the game.
As well as the original rules, there is also some extra features such as minigames to earn special abilities and the option of interrogating other players.

**Can you survive until the end?**

_Available to play on PC_
